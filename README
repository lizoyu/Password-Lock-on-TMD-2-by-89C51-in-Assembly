This program is the final individual project in class Principles of Microcontroller.

It's a 4-number password lock on experimental platform TMD-2 using 89C51 and written in Assembly
language. TMD-2 has a numberpad with 0~9 and a~f, and additional buttons for external interrupt.

Realized functions is as follows:
	1. Being able to insert 4 number at most as password;
	2. Backspace using 'b', confirm using 'a';
	3. Keep the inserion in secret, only showing '8';
	4. Show 'PC' when correct and 'PE' when wrong;
	5. Being able to change the password and need to verify previous password.

Experimental environment:
	1. TMD-2 experimental platform with numberpad;
	2. Windows XP and Windows 8;
	3. Keil C51 uVision 2 and uVision 4;
	4. Flash Magic;
	5. Altium Designer 14.
	
The working status is controlled by several flags, including:
	1. Flag1: Restriction of confirm button 'a' 
	- Forbid confirming when number is not enough to be varified.
	
	2. Flag2: Status of confirm button 'a'
	- Determined if the program can get into the sections of verification.
	
	3. Flag3: Reconfirmation of changing password
	- Before changing password, we have to insert one correct password. When it's correct, Flag3
	will be activated, that we can change password now.
	
	4. Flag4: Confirmation of changeing password
	- After pushing the button for external interrupt, flag4 is activated to show that next inserting
	number is to verify for changing password.

The whole program simply goes like this:
	1. Intialization
	2. Detect insert
		1) 'a': check Flag1 and Flag2;
		2) 'b': delete one number;
		3) others: show number on LED.
	3. Determine to go into several status
		1) Flag2 for verification;
		2) Flag4 for changing password, with Flag3.
